Special Squares

• Square 15 is the 'House of Life'. This is a safe square; a piece cannot be swapped off it. 

• You must land on Square 26, the 'House of Happiness' in order to progress further. This is a safe square.

• Square 27 is the 'House of Water'. Landing on this square sends the piece back to Square 15, the 'House of Life'.

• Pieces can leave the board from Squares 26 ('House of Happiness'}, Square 28 (three ba-birds), Square 29 (two men), and Square 30 ('House of Ra-Horakhty') if the correct number of spaces is thrown. These are all safe squares.
